# TechNova Hackathon

Hi everyone! We are 4 beginner hackers that are super passionate about software development. We have never had an in-person courses after studying at UW for 3 consecutive terms, so we are eager to get back to school as soon as possible! We would like to show our social responsibilities during the pandemic!

## Our team: 404 Inside Out
Members: Carol Duan, Xiaoyue Zhou, Yifan Yang, Yihan Yang

Time: Aug.27 10PM - Aug.29 10AM

## Aim
The THEME of this Hackathon is **bridging the gaps between technology and global issues**. COVID-19, as one of the most significant issues that the world is facing, draws our attention. 
We are creating a shortcut of a data management system that would support the management of students' vaccination records.

## Functionality
- Students can add their personal information and vaccination records via *index.html* page
- Managers can search for a student's record using his/her student ID via *table.html* page
- General statistical information about all students that have registered in the system is displayed graphically in *summary.html* page

## Business Plan
This project aims to provide free service for the institution to manage their students' information safely. In this special moment, we believe that making it free is the best thing that we could do to support the community.

## Future Goals
- Add a place to let students upload their proof of vaccination (format: pdf/jpg)
- Implement the full backend side using a remote DB to store information
- Implement the user system that displays the page differently for students and managers
- Implement the search bar on the table page more wisely by providing more entries
- ...

**We believe that**
## Warriors protect warriors!
