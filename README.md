## Aim
The THEME of this Hackathon is **bridging the gaps between technology and global issues**. COVID-19, as one of the most significant issues that the world is facing, draws our attention. 
We are creating a shortcut of a data management system that would support the management of students' vaccination records.

## Functionality
- Students can add their personal information and vaccination records via *index.html* page
- Managers can search for a student's record using his/her student ID via *table.html* page
- General statistical information about all students that have registered in the system is displayed graphically in *summary.html* page

## Future Goals
- Implement the full backend side using a remote DB to store information
- Implement the user system that displays the page differently for students and managers
- Implement the search bar on the table page more wisely by providing more entries
